TaskNest Project Guide
This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the TaskNest project, a simple task manager with three categories: Today, Upcoming, and Completed.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.
npm (Node Package Manager): npm is included with the Node.js installation.

Note for Windows Users:
If you are using Windows, ensure that npm and MongoDB are correctly set up in your systemâ€™s PATH environment variable. You can check if npm is installed by running:
